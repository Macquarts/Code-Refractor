The Marketing Compay "Horiseon" required us to make changes on their existing webpage, where the new changes met accessability standards when the source code was viewed, so that the site optimized search engines

### Notes:
Semantic HTML elments were required to be executed to follow a logical structure independent of heading attributes and title elements.
